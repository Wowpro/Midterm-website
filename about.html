  <h1>Welcome to WoWpros guides!</h1>
  <h2>What are we?</h2>
  <p>Wowpro guides is a site that helps gamers new and old. The games selected are not in early access and must be release beforehand.</p>
  <h2>What do we do?</h2>
  <p>Wowpro guides, as in the name, makes guides! On what you ask? On most non early access games such as Destiny 2 and  Terraria, to name a few. Of course, with the number of games being added in the near future, the site will expand and
  and grow, adding new and more exciting features. </p>
  <h2>Our team</h2>
  <p>Wowpro guides is run and managed by the one and only, Wowpro! For now of course. In the future he plans to have a team of five to help him manage the guides, each skilled in a different game.</p>
